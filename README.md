SBT testing project
===================

This is a fork of https://github.com/jbruggem/sbt-multiproject-example, but updated to latest scala and simplified
by removing the bits I don't care about.

Working
-------
- `sbt test` on all projects
- `sbt PROJ/run` on projects
- dependencies: banana and apple depend on fruitLib
